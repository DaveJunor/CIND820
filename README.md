# CIND820 - Classification of Remotely Sensed Imagery

The research objectives of this project are to assess the performance of the Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine machine learning algorithms in the multi-class land cover classification of a fused optical-radar dataset (Kosravi, 2020). Using Python Pandas, Numpy, and Scikit-learn libraries each machine learning algorithm experiment will be applied to the same data set. Each model will be evaluated, and the machine learning algorithms compared to determine which one is best for our use case of classifying cropland from a fused optical-radar dataset for a relatively flat and environmentally homogenous area around Winnipeg, Manitoba.
